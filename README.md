**SearchBox is an innovative search engine currently under development, designed to revolutionize how users discover products online by focusing on regional relevance, AI-driven semantic understanding, and exceptional performance.**

## The Challenge: Fragmented & Imprecise Product Discovery

Finding the right product online often involves tedious browsing across numerous brand websites. Traditional search methods typically rely on basic keyword matching, often missing the user's true intent and lacking awareness of regional availability or nuances. This leads to a fragmented, inefficient, and sometimes frustrating experience.

## Our Vision: Unified, Intelligent, Regional Search

SearchBox aims to consolidate product discovery into a single, seamless platform. By leveraging cutting-edge AI and a high-performance backend, we intend to:

*   **Aggregate Data:** Gather product information from a wide array of online brand stores.
*   **Understand Semantically:** Go beyond keywords to grasp the user's actual needs and context using AI.
*   **Prioritize Regionally:** Surface products that are relevant and available in the user's specific geographic area.
*   **Deliver Speed:** Ensure a lightning-fast search experience powered by Go.
*   **Engage Visually:** Present results through a truly intuitive and modern user interface.

## Key Features (Planned & In Development) ‚ú®

*   **üåê Unified Multi-Brand Search:** Access product catalogs from various online stores in one place.
*   **üìç Regional Focus:** Prioritizes results based on user location and regional product availability.
*   **üß† AI-Powered Semantic Understanding:** Uses advanced AI models to interpret search queries contextually, understanding intent beyond literal keywords.
*   **üîé Deep Product Analysis:** AI delves into product details to provide richer insights and more relevant matches.
*   **‚ö° High-Performance Backend:** Built with Go (Golang) for optimal speed, concurrency, and efficiency in data processing.
*   **üîÑ Model Context Protocol (MCP):** Leverages MCP for standardized and efficient retrieval of structured data from third-party sources (online stores).
*   **üé® Exceptional User Interface:** A core focus on delivering a visually appealing, intuitive, and highly responsive UI.
*   **‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Filtering & Sorting:** Options to refine search results based on various product attributes and regional parameters.

## Technology Stack (Planned) üõ†Ô∏è

*   **Backend:** Go (Golang)
*   **AI/ML:** State-of-the-art models for Natural Language Processing (NLP), semantic search, and data analysis.
*   **Data Retrieval:** Model Context Protocol (MCP)
*   **Frontend:** Modern JavaScript Framework (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte - TBD)
*   **Database:** Scalable Database Solution (e.g., PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch - TBD based on scaling needs)
*   **Infrastructure:** Cloud-native deployment (Details TBD)

## High-Level Architecture (Conceptual)

1.  **User Query:** User enters a search query via the frontend UI.
2.  **Frontend:** Sends the query and location context to the backend API.
3.  **Backend (Go):**
    *   Receives the request.
    *   Applies AI models for semantic analysis and query understanding.
    *   Determines relevant data sources (brands/stores).
    *   Utilizes the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to request specific product data from third-party APIs/sources based on the interpreted query and regional context.
4.  **Data Processing:** Aggregates, filters, ranks, and potentially enriches the retrieved product data.
5.  **Response:** Sends the processed, regionally relevant search results back to the frontend.
6.  **Frontend:** Renders the results within the intuitive UI.

## Project Status ‚ö†Ô∏è

**SearchBox is currently under active development.** Key features are being built, and the architecture is being refined. Functionality is not yet complete, and APIs/interfaces may change frequently.

## Getting Started (Preliminary)

As the project is in early stages, setup instructions are limited and subject to change.

1.  **Clone the repository (Link will be active once public):**
    ```bash
    # git clone https://github.com/Haseeb-Arshad/searchbox.git
    # cd searchbox
    ```
2.  **(Placeholder)** Detailed setup instructions for the backend (Go environment, dependencies) and frontend will be added as components stabilize.
3.  **(Placeholder)** Configuration details (API keys, MCP endpoints, database connections) will be documented.

## Contributing

We are excited about building SearchBox and welcome interest! As the project matures, formal contribution guidelines (`CONTRIBUTING.md`) will be established. For now, feel free to watch the repository or reach out if you have specific ideas.
